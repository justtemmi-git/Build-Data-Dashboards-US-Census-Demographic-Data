# Build-Data-Dashboards-US-Census-Demographic-Data
In this project, I created visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. I created data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. My work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
